The photos in this chapter are invaluable and beautiful.\\n\\nCons --\\n\\n-- The \"conversational style\" is something a reader may like, or may not. I did not.  I want a clear explanation of a topic, not a conversation with someone who is trying to be casual, witty and amusing for reasons that don't help the explanation along.  The author is apparently trying, in part, to make the book entertaining enough so that the reader wants to learn about the subject; virtually anyone who buys this book, though, already has enough interest in the subject to sustain them through the reading of the book.\\n\\n-- The text on pages 130 and 131 is juxtaposed one with the other.\\n\\n-- The chapter that many readers would want to be the most complete and cutting-edge (that on care of clams in the aquarium, Chapter 5) is the least informational of the book.  The worst section in that chapter is probably the section on lighting.  This section includes absolutely no mention of lighting intensity in any usably objective terms (PAR or even lux), and wastes five paragraphs with a repetitive monologue of his subjective opinions on the 'looks' of various color temperature bulbs.  This chapter also includes a section on feeding, which spends ALL of its ten pages explaining how, how much, what and when to feed, only to conclude with the recommendation \"if you want to avoid all of this, just do what I've done for years (as have a gazillion other hobbyists) and only keep tridacnids in well-established, well-stocked aquariums with bright lights and don't worry about them.(p. 183)\"  It should also be pointed out that the book devotes most of Chapter 2 to why Tridacnids need not be fed at all!  Lastly, there was no information in the chapter on care of clams that is not currently what passes for common knowledge in the hobby.  While this is fine, in the sense that a book can be usefully a compilation of common practices, I expected more.\\n\\nIn summary: a book that most interested hobbyists will find is worth owning, in spite of the fact that it falls short of a bar that has been set by recent books in the hobby, including Wilkerson's \"Clownfishes\", Borneman's \"Aquarium Corals\" and the three volumes of Delbeek and Sprung's \"The Reef Aquarium\".</td>\n",

The 3 yr old cat was fascinated for about 15 minutes but when the same pictures came on, she got bored.  The 5 year old watched for about a few minutes but then walked away. It is possible that because we have a wonderful courtyard full of greenery and trees and one of my neighbors has a bird feeder, that there is enough going on outside that they prefer real life versus a taped version.  I will more than likely pass this on to a friend who has cats that don't have as much wildlife to watch as mine do.</td>\n",

Since birds are a natural source of food for cats (feral) it was natural that they were instantly attracted to vol. two. Contrary to all the cartoons, cats are not fishermen, and thus, fish, either in a bowl or in the wild are not something they are naturally attracted to. Since gerbils and guinea pigs are not native where I live, they could have been little dogs as far as my cats could tell. Rodents are also a natural food, so volume one was much better than volume three. Also, the quality could have been better (for my eyes only) but my cats could care less about video quality... they just see birds..  LOL</td>\n",

Mistakes happen, but it's the way the mistakes are handled that convince a buyer that a seller is one to trust and use repeatedly, as we shall this seller. We were looking for a booster for our dog and decided on  this one after reading positive reviews. We received the product promptly, but there was a tiny perfectly round hole in the bottom of the vial through which much of the gel had leaked.  We were very disappointed, as our pup really could have used an immune booster. The seller arranged immediately for a refund and sent a new bottle of the gel without charge.  What more can be said?

       "      <td>The poster who stated that Cesar's methods are archaic and use pain to correct the dogs obviously hasn't spent time watching the show.\\n\\nCesar never causes the dogs any pain or injury. In fact, several of the dogs on his show have bitten holes in his hands but he never, never reacts in a way that is painful to the dog. He maintains his calm assertive self.\\n\\nCesar's corrections consist of a noise \"shhhh\" and a brief tug on the leash. Cesar works with the type of collar the owner has on the dog. That may be buckle, choke, martingale, or pinch/prong. None of Cesar's corrections are physically damaging to the dog. Incidentally, the prong/pinch collar is not a cruel device when used correctly. It is meant as a TRAINING AID, to be used for no more than 2 weeks to help gain control of larger dogs that need help mastering leash etiquette. A person should ALWAYS consult a professional trainer for information on the proper use of pinch/prong collars. Shock collars should never be used unless they are set on a \"beep\" only setting and under the supervision of a professional.\\n\\nPlease, if you own a dog, watch this show! This DVD set is filled with valuable information about canines and our relationship with them. Cesar gives good information in a no nonsense way that anyone can follow. The first season was wonderful, and you can bet I'm going to tune in for season two! Our canines need an advocate like Cesar.\\n\\nI'd give this two thumbs up!</td>\n",

       "      <td>I have acquired an American Eskimo about 3 years ago and have been searching, buying and trying a lot of books, training courses and dog obedient classes since.  I ran across the TV show recently when I switched TV to satellite.  I only wish I have found out about this earlier.\\n\\nA lot of the reviewers have covered almost every aspects, I just want to include a few points from my views from the shows.\\n\\nThe whole idea of Cesar's method is really simple, be the pack leader and the dog will follow, that will indirectly solve most of the unwanted behavior.  Although the execution is more complicated plus he has a pack of dogs to help him(this is a significant tool that most of us or other dog trainer lack of).\\n\\nI have owned Season 1, 2 &amp; 3 in DVD, plus all the episodes I have taped from Season 4 to 7.  I cannot find any evidence of inhuman behavior or forces as described by some viewers.  Pinning the dog down is the most \"violent\" I have seen but even that, Cesar did not use force or tool, he was only making the dog in a laying down position.  In face, Cesar has been bitten quite a few times!!  And the touches he uses are for correction, if that's really hurting dogs, I am sure the dogs would have attacked Cesar already.\\n\\nAll dogs seems to responded to Cesar all the time and his touches are so effective, almost like miracles.  Let's not forget he is gifted with some ability such as feeling the dog's energy.  He always touch before the dog escalate.  Until we practice this, we'll never have as effective touch as he is, but the shows are definitely fun to watch, just don't expect the same result.\\n\\nThe last point I want to make is about the comment of his technique.  Some viewer regard it as old school.  It is probably true but then it will always works as long as following the leader is still in the DNA.  This is still true today for pack animal such as lions or elephants.  In fact, all those so called new technique does not work well for abused dogs.  I believe Cesar's method covers a much more variety of situation.</td>\n",

It has both a woman and a man speaking. Pet store recommends to buy a female voice Only on bird cds because birds respond to female voice better. Con: there's some real stupid things said on this CD. Prefer female voice because pet shop recommends female voice. Pros: it's cheap. I will review again in 6 months see if my Polly picks up few words.   \n",

Parrots have the mental capacity of a 3-5 year old child. This is like plopping your child down in front of the TV and calling it quality time. Parrots learn to communicate dynamically not by rote. I have 5 parrots and all are chatty because we chat, while cleaning, cooking, doing laundry.. whatever. Turn off the TV and read aloud, talk, sing, dance.. be one of the flock.   \n",

You can choose to repeat whatever phrase you want your bird to say. Or just play the entire CD. Wish some of the phrases provided included the word \"parakeet\" since it includes others such as cockatiel or parrot.   \n",

       "16  My impressions of Fatherree's book:\\n\\nPros --\\n\\n-- The photos are almost without exception beautiful and help to explain and illustrate points the author is trying to make.\\n\\n-- Chapter 6 (\"Tridacnid troubles) sets out a good amount of information on diseases that I have never seen in any other place.\\n\\n-- The third chapter, on identification of the various species, is very useful, clear and well done overall.  The photos in this chapter are invaluable and beautiful.\\n\\nCons --\\n\\n-- The \"conversational style\" is something a reader may like, or may not. I did not.  I want a clear explanation of a topic, not a conversation with someone who is trying to be casual, witty and amusing for reasons that don't help the explanation along.  The author is apparently trying, in part, to make the book entertaining enough so that the reader wants to learn about the subject; virtually anyone who buys this book, though, already has enough interest in the subject to sustain them through the reading of the book.\\n\\n-- The text on pages 130 and 131 is juxtaposed one with the other.\\n\\n-- The chapter that many readers would want to be the most complete and cutting-edge (that on care of clams in the aquarium, Chapter 5) is the least informational of the book.  The worst section in that chapter is probably the section on lighting.  This section includes absolutely no mention of lighting intensity in any usably objective terms (PAR or even lux), and wastes five paragraphs with a repetitive monologue of his subjective opinions on the 'looks' of various color temperature bulbs.  This chapter also includes a section on feeding, which spends ALL of its ten pages explaining how, how much, what and when to feed, only to conclude with the recommendation \"if you want to avoid all of this, just do what I've done for years (as have a gazillion other hobbyists) and only keep tridacnids in well-established, well-stocked aquariums with bright lights and don't worry about them.(p. 183)\"  It should also be pointed out that the book devotes most of Chapter 2 to why Tridacnids need not be fed at all!  Lastly, there was no information in the chapter on care of clams that is not currently what passes for common knowledge in the hobby.  While this is fine, in the sense that a book can be usefully a compilation of common practices, I expected more.\\n\\nIn summary: a book that most interested hobbyists will find is worth owning, in spite of the fact that it falls short of a bar that has been set by recent books in the hobby, including Wilkerson's \"Clownfishes\", Borneman's \"Aquarium Corals\" and the three volumes of Delbeek and Sprung's \"The Reef Aquarium\".   \n",

The 3 yr old cat was fascinated for about 15 minutes but when the same pictures came on, she got bored.  The 5 year old watched for about a few minutes but then walked away. It is possible that because we have a wonderful courtyard full of greenery and trees and one of my neighbors has a bird feeder, that there is enough going on outside that they prefer real life versus a taped version.  I will more than likely pass this on to a friend who has cats that don't have as much wildlife to watch as mine do.   \n",

If they can't smell it, they don't care. Maybe yours do.  But, well, unless yours do already, don't bother with these TV time cat videos.   \n",

In the beginning they tried to get the birds by reaching behind the television but once they got used to the deal they settled down and just watched intently.  It was funny when a bird would fly out of the picture the cats would want to dart that way too.   \n",

It appears that volume 2 is the most well received of the three and the one I would recommend.  It's funny to watch my cat watch it bc she looks behind the TV trying to find the birds.  I turn this on sometimes when I'm leaving the house, by the time I get home, she doesn't seem to be paying attention anymore but figured she'd at least enjoy the sounds.   \n",

I read all the reviews, and knew that vol. two was the best, hands down, but for few extra dollars I decided to get all three in a combo pack.  Since birds are a natural source of food for cats (feral) it was natural that they were instantly attracted to vol. two. Contrary to all the cartoons, cats are not fishermen, and thus, fish, either in a bowl or in the wild are not something they are naturally attracted to. Since gerbils and guinea pigs are not native where I live, they could have been little dogs as far as my cats could tell. Rodents are also a natural food, so volume one was much better than volume three. Also, the quality could have been better (for my eyes only) but my cats could care less about video quality... they just see birds..  LOL   \n",

Mistakes happen, but it's the way the mistakes are handled that convince a buyer that a seller is one to trust and use repeatedly, as we shall this seller. We were looking for a booster for our dog and decided on  this one after reading positive reviews. We received the product promptly, but there was a tiny perfectly round hole in the bottom of the vial through which much of the gel had leaked.  We were very disappointed, as our pup really could have used an immune booster. The seller arranged immediately for a refund and sent a new bottle of the gel without charge.  What more can be said?

HE SHOWS HOW SIMPLE CORRECTIONS CAN BRING ABOUT INSTANT RESULTS WITHOUT HAVING TO BE AGGRESSIVE OR ABUSIVE TO THE ANIMAL.  I'M NOT SURE WHAT BOOK OR PROGRAM THE OTHER REVIEWER IS WATCHING, BECAUSE ANYONE WHO IS CONSISTENT WITH CESARS TECHNIQUES WILL GET THE DESIRED RESULTS.  I'VE WATCHED HIS PROGRAM SINCE THE BEGINNING AND HAVE ADDED HIS BOOK TO THE MANY OTHERS I REFER TO IN MY WORK.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND HIS BOOK TO ANYONE WHO WANTS TO HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR DOG!!   \n",

In fact, several of the dogs on his show have bitten holes in his hands but he never, never reacts in a way that is painful to the dog. He maintains his calm assertive self.\\n\\nCesar's corrections consist of a noise \"shhhh\" and a brief tug on the leash. Cesar works with the type of collar the owner has on the dog. That may be buckle, choke, martingale, or pinch/prong. None of Cesar's corrections are physically damaging to the dog. Incidentally, the prong/pinch collar is not a cruel device when used correctly. It is meant as a TRAINING AID, to be used for no more than 2 weeks to help gain control of larger dogs that need help mastering leash etiquette. A person should ALWAYS consult a professional trainer for information on the proper use of pinch/prong collars. Shock collars should never be used unless they are set on a \"beep\" only setting and under the supervision of a professional.\\n\\nPlease, if you own a dog, watch this show! This DVD set is filled with valuable information about canines and our relationship with them. Cesar gives good information in a no nonsense way that anyone can follow. The first season was wonderful, and you can bet I'm going to tune in for season two! Our canines need an advocate like Cesar.\\n\\nI'd give this two thumbs up!   \n",

Normally, I do not buy \"used\" DVD's, CD's or Books unless the product is rated \"nearly new\" or in \"very good\" condition. The seller rated this product \"good\" so I was hesitant but ordered anyway because of the great price (under $8 for the entire first season). I was ecstatic when it arrived only a few short days after I ordered it and in my opinion was in \"nearly new\" condition. I appreciate the sellers honesty regarding the condition of the outer casing and would not hesitate to order from this seller again. I greatly appreciate the speed and integrity in which they demonstrated with this fantastic DVD series.   \n",

I ran across the TV show recently when I switched TV to satellite.  I only wish I have found out about this earlier.\\n\\nA lot of the reviewers have covered almost every aspects, I just want to include a few points from my views from the shows.\\n\\nThe whole idea of Cesar's method is really simple, be the pack leader and the dog will follow, that will indirectly solve most of the unwanted behavior.  Although the execution is more complicated plus he has a pack of dogs to help him(this is a significant tool that most of us or other dog trainer lack of).\\n\\nI have owned Season 1, 2 & 3 in DVD, plus all the episodes I have taped from Season 4 to 7.  I cannot find any evidence of inhuman behavior or forces as described by some viewers.  Pinning the dog down is the most \"violent\" I have seen but even that, Cesar did not use force or tool, he was only making the dog in a laying down position.  In face, Cesar has been bitten quite a few times!!  And the touches he uses are for correction, if that's really hurting dogs, I am sure the dogs would have attacked Cesar already.\\n\\nAll dogs seems to responded to Cesar all the time and his touches are so effective, almost like miracles.  Let's not forget he is gifted with some ability such as feeling the dog's energy.  He always touch before the dog escalate.  Until we practice this, we'll never have as effective touch as he is, but the shows are definitely fun to watch, just don't expect the same result.\\n\\nThe last point I want to make is about the comment of his technique.  Some viewer regard it as old school.  It is probably true but then it will always works as long as following the leader is still in the DNA.  This is still true today for pack animal such as lions or elephants.  In fact, all those so called new technique does not work well for abused dogs.  I believe Cesar's method covers a much more variety of situation.   \n",

From time to time I go back to this first season to refresh myself on some of the basics of his method and philosophy. I enjoy these episodes every time.   \n",

He has the ability to get the most misbehaved dogs and rehab them to get them back to being great companions.  The only problem with the series that I have is the story is almost always the same.  Aggressive dog, Ceasar comes and teaches the owners to be better pack leaders, thus dog becomes less aggressive.  I would love to see more episodes focused on other problems besides aggressive dogs.   \n",

All have come from homes where the original \"owners\" tired of them for one reason or another.  This motley crew did not immediately become a happy pack.  I had no idea how to deal with the problem.  Then I watched Cesar Millan's Dog Whisperer--over and over.  I immediately began to use Cesar's approach: seeing myself as the pack leader, exercising the dogs more (and together!), behaving more like the dogs' mothers would have behaved (yes, I applied a bit of pressure to the neck with my fingertips--the Mom \"bite\").  Now I have a happy, peaceful pack of contented, well-exercised, balanced dogs.  And I am a happy, peaceful pack leader.  Now my dogs are not a source of frustration and guilt, but a source of joy, love, and connectedness.  Cesar is a wonder!   \n",

She's improved amazingly on her walks but there is still a lot I need to train her on. Watching what he does dog after dog, makes me want to stop everything a get to work.  I think he's amazing at what he does, and watching the video you are reminded of that over and over again.  The only negative thing I have to say about the disc set is that unlike when the show airs on the national geographic channel, it doesn't give you an update on how the dog is doing after the session.  Otherwise, it's highly recommended!   \n",

It gets a bit repetitive but the repetition does bring home the lessons. My dogs and I are better for it; much more cooperation between us. The extras were a waste of time, quite frankly, and could be left out. All in all,worth the time.   \n",

Not exclusively, mind you, but I definitely wanted to incude some fresh food along with her (high quality) kibble.\\n\\nThis book has plenty of great recipes for every meal, from breakfast to dinner, desserts, special occasions, and even training snacks. There are also recipes for homemade kibble and Kong toy stuffing. Plus there is some information on what not to feed a dog (like onions and grapes).

He liked his existing Norelco so much better that he returned the new razor and bought the replacement heads for his old. He said he's glad he did, and the blades are doing a great job!   \n",

It was a hot item for sure, my receptionist was the final winner and she said she's amazed at how soft the bristles are.  A great little set that's affordable and makes good gifts.   \n",

I have an older brush that is not retractable and have never been able to clean it thoroughly. I have six dogs and they all like It, my one dog Frenchie loves it. She has always like me scratching her back, I think this is why she like it so much.   \n",

My dogs loved how it felt and it left them feeling nice and smooth! The clean up was the best part, it didn't leave the hair clumped up in the brush like my old brush! I'm going to tell all my friends about this brush!   \n",

I use it for steaks also, to make sure they are cooked just right. I have had this product for several years and the battery is still good. I wanted to get one for my son, but I can't find it anywhere online. Amazon doesn't have it and doesn't know when they will again. Even the AcuRite website doesn't have it. I guess it was discontinued. How can you discontinue such a great item?   \n",

I'm not exactly sure of his shoulder height, maybe 27 inches or so, but he weighs a bit over 85 pounds.\\nThis bed is plenty big for him.  As you can see in the 6th. picture, my dog wasn't quite sure what to do with all the room but he eventually decided to spread out a bit.  The last two pictures shows him deciding to use the bolster as a pillow that goes around the entire bed.\\nI question the one reviewer, who isn't verified, because she says about opening the velcro.  In the first and in particular, the second picture, you can see that it has a zippered closure in the back.  Instead of going all the way around the bed as some pet beds have, this one is centered in the back.\\nThe third picture shows the gel lining which is baffled into sections so that all the gel does not move to one place.  The fourth picture gives you a closeup of the gel.  The 5th. picture shows the foam lining.  I'd guess it to be about 1/2 inch.\\nI'm deducting one star because this same type of gel packs are used to soothe aches in pains in humans.  They can either be microwaved for warmth or chilled in the freezer.\\nI actually have one like I'm referring to which works great&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Lower-Back-Gel-Beads-Hot-Cold-Therapy-Wrap-Compress-Pack-Fabric-Cover-Reusable-gel-beads-provides-both-ice-heat-pain-relief-and-rehab-treatments-Great-for-sports-injuries-chronic-pain-more/dp/B00W0CINXW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;Lower Back Gel Beads Hot &amp; Cold Therapy Wrap Compress Pack + Fabric Cover - Reusable gel beads provides both ice / heat pain relief and rehab treatments. Great for sports injuries, chronic pain + more&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for my aches and pains.  Granted, they are gel beads but to me it looks to be the same concept.  Maybe someone can correct me if I'm wrong.\\nI don't mind though as this would make this bed useful year round.  I would think in the winter it would hold the animal's body heat.\\nI'm just unsure of the description as \"cooling\" bed.  Love the size and the sale price is very reasonable for the size bed I purchased.  Personally, I wouldn't pay the full price for it as it's out of my budget and if I did, I would expect more padding or thicker foam that it has.\\n\\nUPDATE:  August 26, 2016\\nUnfortunately my dog decided to move his bed to another area of the the house.  In doing so, he bit through the gel liner and I now have a blue stain on my hardwood floor!\\nI can't blame the manufacturer but I can blame my dog.  I also feel I should warn pet owners that if you own a dog that likes to rearrange his things like mine does, be aware that you could wind up having this happen to you!!.\\nRight now I pulled out the good 'ole duct tape and patched it up.

       "      <td>My dogs were pretty picky about this kind of probiotic. It had a strange consistency, much like a silky powder I would relate to a baby powder. Not something you would think edible.  I have used another type that is also on here that is more expensive but the dogs eat up and you see the effects right away. We have dogs that have skins and stomach problems. They do very well on that Brand which I cannot elaborate I am told by Amazon. :/  I think that is proof that this brand is so-so because I really think it has may have some of the probiotics in it but the by products are over powering. There is definitely more by products in this brand then I would like so I went back to the other brand. I ended up throwing it away because I did not see results plus my dogs would not touch the stuff after a couple of times. .</td>\n",

He lived on the streets no one is sure for how long but somehow he managed to survive long enough to be rescued, lived in a shelter, and then was fostered by a family who surely loved him because he is so darn cute.  I adopted him four years ago, and somehow hes become the worlds pickiest eater.  A little gourmet. If it doesnt meet his special tastes he would rather starve! But one thing he loves is his chicken. So when I found these on Amazon I decided to give it a try. He certainly wasn't eating the other snacks I was wasting my money on. Well I hit the mother lode.  He loves these treats, he begs for them and he just cant get enough. I actually have to limit them. There are a few other treats that he likes from Amazon too, but these are his favorites.</td>\n",

They are made for puppies so my medium sized dog ate one in one bite so make sure to notice who they are for, but my smaller sized dog liked them.  I received a discount in exchange for my opinion which is good for my smaller 10 lb. dog, but these definitely are not made for adult dogs or medium/large sized dogs who could eat five in one bite.</td>\n",

I have purchased other products though this some pet snack company and know to double-check the instructions for not giving to puppies under 9 months for the small breeds and under 6 months for the large breeds.  I DO think this should be publicized in the main description front page in addition to the product description further down the page.\\nAs for the treat itself, my large breed german shepherd will chew on this without complaint.  He is not particularly finicky, however, and will do just about anything for a treat.  I love that this is made with 100 percent natural ingredients and that this keeps him from having bad breath.  He likes to get nice and close to visit with me so I get a pretty good sense of what is working for the breath and what is not!\\nDISCLOSURE  This product was received at a discount in exchange for an unbiased, honest review.

The problem is the wand. I've barely had it a month and it's broken. I still use the string with the feather but its not the same. She loves this toy so much but now we can't use it. Hopefully they make the wand sturdier.</td>\n",

The way the lid sits on the base.  I have a male cat who sometimes stands up to urinate (similar to spraying to mark territory).  For whatever reason, the lid and base do not connect very well.  You have to remove the lid in order to scoop, and I'm constantly wiping urine off of the lid so that it doesn't get on my floor.  I have NOT had this problem with previous rectangular litter boxes.\\n2. The corners.  Obviously a corner litter box will have corners.  But they are really difficult to clean.  I have tried two different sized scoopers now and it's almost impossible to remove urine clumps that are deposited in the corners.  They just crumble into more of a mess.  There are additional indents near the front, which again make it difficult to scoop out anything deposited against the front of the box.\\n\\nI'm just really disappointed.  If I could, I would return it, but that option is no longer available to me.</td>\n",

Then i touched her neck and she looked at me like please take this thing off.  The smell was so over powering that she couldn't smell her food and didn't want to eat.

Multiple fecal tests over the course of his life have shown nothing wrong. We found an awesome dog food that helped his poops be solid, but then he went on antibiotics. The diarrhea from the antibiotics was persistent for weeks after he had finished taking them, and I tried a lot of stuff. We noticed an immediate difference after giving this to him. The next day, his poop was solid. We gave this to him for 2 weeks and his poops have been excellent since. We have ordered extra to have on hand for any episodes.  We have tried other probiotics in the past but this is the only one that has made such a noticeable difference. I am beyond stoked to have found this stuff!</td>\n",

I would be tempted to purchase more if the price were lower - I'm forced to view them as more of a disposable item than a durable, long-lasting toy and therefore the high expense is a big deterrent. My advice to the manufacturer: find a way to make the squeaker more durable, or lower the cost of the overall item. My advice to other customers: the price has increased by $7 since I purchased the small set of three, so use a price tracker (like camelcamelcamel) to avoid peak pricing, and treat the toy as one which only comes out during special occasions in order to make it last longer.</td>\n",

I'm not exactly sure of his shoulder height, maybe 27 inches or so, but he weighs a bit over 85 pounds.\\nThis bed is plenty big for him.  As you can see in the 6th. picture, my dog wasn't quite sure what to do with all the room but he eventually decided to spread out a bit.  The last two pictures shows him deciding to use the bolster as a pillow that goes around the entire bed.\\nI question the one reviewer, who isn't verified, because she says about opening the velcro.  In the first and in particular, the second picture, you can see that it has a zippered closure in the back.  Instead of going all the way around the bed as some pet beds have, this one is centered in the back.\\nThe third picture shows the gel lining which is baffled into sections so that all the gel does not move to one place.  The fourth picture gives you a closeup of the gel.  The 5th. picture shows the foam lining.  I'd guess it to be about 1/2 inch.\\nI'm deducting one star because this same type of gel packs are used to soothe aches in pains in humans.  They can either be microwaved for warmth or chilled in the freezer.\\nI actually have one like I'm referring to which works great&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Lower-Back-Gel-Beads-Hot-Cold-Therapy-Wrap-Compress-Pack-Fabric-Cover-Reusable-gel-beads-provides-both-ice-heat-pain-relief-and-rehab-treatments-Great-for-sports-injuries-chronic-pain-more/dp/B00W0CINXW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Lower Back Gel Beads Hot & Cold Therapy Wrap Compress Pack + Fabric Cover - Reusable gel beads provides both ice / heat pain relief and rehab treatments. Great for sports injuries, chronic pain + more</a>&nbsp;for my aches and pains.  Granted, they are gel beads but to me it looks to be the same concept.  Maybe someone can correct me if I'm wrong.\\nI don't mind though as this would make this bed useful year round.  I would think in the winter it would hold the animal's body heat.\\nI'm just unsure of the description as \"cooling\" bed.  Love the size and the sale price is very reasonable for the size bed I purchased.  Personally, I wouldn't pay the full price for it as it's out of my budget and if I did, I would expect more padding or thicker foam that it has.\\n\\nUPDATE:  August 26, 2016\\nUnfortunately my dog decided to move his bed to another area of the the house.  In doing so, he bit through the gel liner and I now have a blue stain on my hardwood floor!\\nI can't blame the manufacturer but I can blame my dog.  I also feel I should warn pet owners that if you own a dog that likes to rearrange his things like mine does, be aware that you could wind up having this happen to you!!.\\nRight now I pulled out the good 'ole duct tape and patched it up.  Hey, another use for duct tape!!  Ha Ha   \n",

The vet told us the pain pills are helpful, but can cause ulcers, so to prevent the ulcers, our pup was prescribed FortiFlora, but that's WAY expensive! This stuff lasts WAY longer, is half the price, and does the same thing :) Now our dog is pain free and not at risk for ulcers  :)   \n",

It had a strange consistency, much like a silky powder I would relate to a baby powder. Not something you would think edible.  I have used another type that is also on here that is more expensive but the dogs eat up and you see the effects right away. We have dogs that have skins and stomach problems. They do very well on that Brand which I cannot elaborate I am told by Amazon. :/  I think that is proof that this brand is so-so because I really think it has may have some of the probiotics in it but the by products are over powering. There is definitely more by products in this brand then I would like so I went back to the other brand. I ended up throwing it away because I did not see results plus my dogs would not touch the stuff after a couple of times. .   \n",

I have tried the chicken skewers, but she sometimes has trouble chewing up the rawhide stick.  Not so with these. They are softer, with a cod and rice center, instead of rawhide.  They are easier for her to chew, and also healthier with the fish center.  She loves them, and these are great for her skin and fur, with omega -3 and 6's in them.  She eats better than I do!   \n",

She LOVED, LOVED, LOVED these! She loved them so much she tried stealing the container on several occasions. These are good-sized treats and they kept her busy and helped her chill-out prior to bedtime. We'll be getting more to keep handy.   \n",

They all loved these treats. I was worried they wouldn't, but they ate them so fast that they probably didn't taste a thing!   \n",

He lived on the streets no one is sure for how long but somehow he managed to survive long enough to be rescued, lived in a shelter, and then was fostered by a family who surely loved him because he is so darn cute.  I adopted him four years ago, and somehow hes become the worlds pickiest eater.  A little gourmet. If it doesnt meet his special tastes he would rather starve! But one thing he loves is his chicken. So when I found these on Amazon I decided to give it a try. He certainly wasn't eating the other snacks I was wasting my money on. Well I hit the mother lode.  He loves these treats, he begs for them and he just cant get enough. I actually have to limit them. There are a few other treats that he likes from Amazon too, but these are his favorites.   \n",

I wish Amazon had sample packages of their doggie treats that way the customer can test the treats on their dogs before we buy the container. Usually when I give my dog a treat he jumps for joy, but when I opened up these puppy chews he sniffed them then turned and walked away. Oh well, I' guess I'll have to try something else.   \n",

They are not smelly or too messy which is great in my car.  I also like the carrying handle top which I hang on a hook in my car away from mischievous paws.  They are made for puppies so my medium sized dog ate one in one bite so make sure to notice who they are for, but my smaller sized dog liked them.  I received a discount in exchange for my opinion which is good for my smaller 10 lb. dog, but these definitely are not made for adult dogs or medium/large sized dogs who could eat five in one bite.   \n",

My puppies love this treat and there is plenty of snacks to last for a while! I'm pretty sure that these are good for your dog's teeth as well. I love the container, it's reusable for other treats or bows for my dogs. Overall, I'm completely satisfied with these and plan on purchasing more when they run out.\\nDISCLOSURE  This product was received at a discount in exchange for an unbiased, honest review.

I have purchased other products though this some pet snack company and know to double-check the instructions for not giving to puppies under 9 months for the small breeds and under 6 months for the large breeds.  I DO think this should be publicized in the main description front page in addition to the product description further down the page.\\nAs for the treat itself, my large breed german shepherd will chew on this without complaint.  He is not particularly finicky, however, and will do just about anything for a treat.  I love that this is made with 100 percent natural ingredients and that this keeps him from having bad breath.  He likes to get nice and close to visit with me so I get a pretty good sense of what is working for the breath and what is not!\\nDISCLOSURE  This product was received at a discount in exchange for an unbiased, honest review.

I am giving this item four stars for meat texture because the jerky is soft and meaty. I don't know why my dogs didn't like them but oh well I guess I will try something else.   \n",

I use them to trim my cats' back end hair when it gets matted or dirty. They are very quiet, hold a charge and all of my cats react without fear to them. They are perfect for my small jobs.   \n",

I need more experience using it but so far it's great to get give him a trim and keep the hair out of his eyes and off of his paws. Would recommend to anyone who needs to do trims at home. Quiet and my dog relaxes for the most part and thinks I'm brushing him.   \n",

The feathers on the end are well designed; some of the best I've seen. One of them mimicks a flying bird so well it even makes the same sound. The problem is the wand. I've barely had it a month and it's broken. I still use the string with the feather but its not the same. She loves this toy so much but now we can't use it. Hopefully they make the wand sturdier.   \n",

They wash fairly well. I wash these in light soiled cycle in my wash machine. I place a paper towel inside  of these and when it gets soiled I replace the towel, the pants or both as needed. They are easy to put on and take off. They are affordable and aptly priced. I liked that the seller was good and with quick shipping. I placed two orders. The first order came packaged in a box with item inside a plastic bag--great packaging. The second came vacuum sealed (shrink wrapped like a boat in winter). This kind of messed up the item. My only suggestion is to request they be packaged without shrink wrap   \n",

I wanted to try these on my male as well, since belly bands wouldn't work (they just slide up/down). These were almost perfect....they just don't come up quite high enough on the belly to cover what needs to be covered. The sizing you really need to measure and pay attention to, I'm glad the seller didn't just list by breed. I have 3 pugs, who wear 3 different sizes.   \n",

I had some concerns with it being a corner one but its quite big. I like how little space it takes up while still being roomy. It's also deep which my digger cats like. We removed the door because our cats dislike them. The material is shiny, makes it super easy to clean. Its the perfect litterbox   \n",

The lid also doesn't connect to the base well and I'm constantly wiping up urine.  Two stars for those reasons:\\n1. The way the lid sits on the base.  I have a male cat who sometimes stands up to urinate (similar to spraying to mark territory).  For whatever reason, the lid and base do not connect very well.  You have to remove the lid in order to scoop, and I'm constantly wiping urine off of the lid so that it doesn't get on my floor.  I have NOT had this problem with previous rectangular litter boxes.\\n2. The corners.  Obviously a corner litter box will have corners.  But they are really difficult to clean.  I have tried two different sized scoopers now and it's almost impossible to remove urine clumps that are deposited in the corners.  They just crumble into more of a mess.  There are additional indents near the front, which again make it difficult to scoop out anything deposited against the front of the box.\\n\\nI'm just really disappointed.  If I could, I would return it, but that option is no longer available to me.   \n",

Ranch raised aka has fleas cause he was raised outside, needed protection for the cat.  Got her this, cause petsmart said it was a good budget friendly option. I should have spent the extra money on the drops.  The smell from this flea collar took my confident cat and made her hide under the bed for the past two days.  At first i thought it was the puppy.  Then i touched her neck and she looked at me like please take this thing off.  The smell was so over powering that she couldn't smell her food and didn't want to eat.  Within 30 minutes of that collar coming off, she was downstairs, glaring at us and the dog, no longer hiding.  Just spend the money on drops. Dont make your cat wear an air freshener.   \n",

It works pretty well, but my Shih-tzu mix has long hair so it can get caught sometimes as I'm combing him. I think it probably works great on dogs with (short) \"fur\" vs dogs with (long) \"hair\". It's a nice comb to have to get rid of any debris on my dog.   \n",

Recommend if you want to save $ and it works.   \n",

He will get random bouts of diarrhea. Multiple fecal tests over the course of his life have shown nothing wrong. We found an awesome dog food that helped his poops be solid, but then he went on antibiotics. The diarrhea from the antibiotics was persistent for weeks after he had finished taking them, and I tried a lot of stuff. We noticed an immediate difference after giving this to him. The next day, his poop was solid. We gave this to him for 2 weeks and his poops have been excellent since. We have ordered extra to have on hand for any episodes.  We have tried other probiotics in the past but this is the only one that has made such a noticeable difference. I am beyond stoked to have found this stuff!   \n",

I bought them for my little dog but shes not able to pick them up with her mouth. Also, in the picture they look solid. They are bigger than a jack ball. Otherwise, they might be good for someone else.   \n",

I was surprised and happy. Love the toy and would recommend it.   \n",

He still plays with them and tries to make them squeak, but no sound comes out. I would be tempted to purchase more if the price were lower - I'm forced to view them as more of a disposable item than a durable, long-lasting toy and therefore the high expense is a big deterrent. My advice to the manufacturer: find a way to make the squeaker more durable, or lower the cost of the overall item. My advice to other customers: the price has increased by $7 since I purchased the small set of three, so use a price tracker (like camelcamelcamel) to avoid peak pricing, and treat the toy as one which only comes out during special occasions in order to make it last longer.   \n",

Easy for her to squeek (unlike other toys we purchased) and the shape slows the rolling a little bit so they don't roll away too fast. We're missing a couple of them, (under something no doubt) so I'll be buying more soon.   \n",
